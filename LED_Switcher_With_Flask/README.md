  This project uses the Raspberry Pi and the Flask web framework to create a web application for controlling LED lights. The Flask framework, written in Python, is used to build a web interface that allows users to turn an LED light on or off with the click of a button. The Raspberry Pi acts as the hardware platform for the project, providing the necessary inputs and outputs for the LED lights. This project is a great demonstration of how the Raspberry Pi and Flask can be used together to create a simple yet powerful web application for controlling physical devices.
